Oh, there’s a lot that excites me in this film. It’s his second solo outing but we’ve seen a lot of him in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, most recently in Marvel Studios’ Spider-Man: No Way Home. It’s always a thrill when you know you’re going to be challenging a character and testing his limits and then seeing how those challenges reshape him. And at the same time it’s a vehicle for the most fantastic new phase of Marvel Studios, this fourth phase of the universe.
